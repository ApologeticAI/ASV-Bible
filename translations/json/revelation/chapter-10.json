      "comment": "This vision echoes Old Testament images of divine presence (Ezekiel 1:28, Exodus 13:21). Some interpreters see this mighty angel as symbolizing Christ himself, given the glowing description, while others see him as an angelic messenger bearing God’s authority. The cloud and rainbow represent God's covenant and glorious presence."

      "comment": "Eating the scroll signifies internalizing God’s message (Ezek. 3:3; Ps. 119:103). The dual taste—sweet as honey, yet bitter—shows God's word brings joy but also can bring suffering or difficult burdens for the prophet and hearers alike."
