The humility displayed engages both literal and spiritual senses: even the wise are called to submit before divine mystery.

This prefigures spiritual transformation: the true penitent, restored after suffering, is led to deeper communion through humble confession. It's an image of conversion found in prophets and in practice among early believers."
