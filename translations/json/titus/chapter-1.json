      "comment": "Paul identifies himself as both servant and apostle, showing authority to teach and shepherd. The reference to 'God's chosen people' aligns with the continuity of God's saving plan from Israel to the Church (see Rom. 11:5). The unity of faith and truth leading to godliness hints at both belief and transformation of life within the community of believers."

The reference to 'before time began' points to an ancient plan, supporting the idea of a church built on divine promise, not human invention."

Paul’s commission comes 'by command,' highlighting apostolic authority as something transmitted by God, not self-appointed. The term 'God our Savior' connects the identity of God as Redeemer, preparing for later explicit connections between Jesus and God."
