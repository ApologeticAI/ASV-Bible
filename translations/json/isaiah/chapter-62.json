      "comment": "Isaiah speaks prophetically of a time when Jerusalem’s righteousness will be clear to all. The emphasis on righteousness and salvation foreshadows Christ bringing salvation to Israel and the nations. The ‘dawn’ and ‘torch’ imagery highlights the visibility and radiance of God’s saving work (see Luke 1:78)."

      "comment": "The prophecy of the nations seeing Israel’s righteousness suggests the universal call to holiness, fulfilled in Christ and echoed in the Church’s mission in the world (Matthew 28:19). The ‘new name’ points to the identity God gives His people, much like how believers are called ‘Christians’ and share in the new covenant."

      "comment": "The transformation from ‘Forsaken’ to ‘Married’ uses nuptial language, foreshadowing Christ as the bridegroom and the Church as His bride (Eph. 5:25-27; Rev. 21:2). This draws out a sacramental view of God’s covenant love—an unbreakable bond reflecting divine union."

      "comment": "Continual prayer moves God to act, demonstrating the efficacy of persistent supplication, much like Jesus teaches in the parable of the persistent widow. Jerusalem being ‘a praise in the earth’ has both literal and spiritual applications—pointing ahead to the establishment of God’s kingdom."
