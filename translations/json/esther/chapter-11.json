        "comment": "This verse emphasizes the extent of King Xerxes’ authority, ruling over a vast domain. The narrative context highlights the power and order established by earthly kings, setting up a contrast with the sovereignty of God (Dan. 2:37-38). The use of 'islands of the sea' references the broadness of his reign, similar to themes in Psalms about God's universal dominion (Ps. 72:8)."
