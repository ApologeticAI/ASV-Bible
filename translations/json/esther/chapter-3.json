      "comment": "Haman's lineage as an Agagite links him to Israel's ancient enemies, connecting this conflict with the spiritual struggle found throughout Scripture. The raising up of a single official foreshadows later biblical instances of promotion and authority. The king's action intensifies the tension between good and evil, which resonates with the drama seen throughout salvation history."
