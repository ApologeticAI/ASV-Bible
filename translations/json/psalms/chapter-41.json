Jesus' teaching in <a href='/AIV/40/5/7'>Matthew 5:7</a> echoes this theme. Note the encouragement of personal holiness expressed through acts of mercy—a unifying act of worship and love."

This hostility toward the righteous prefigures Christ’s own suffering at the hands of His adversaries (<a href='/AIV/43/8/59'>John 8:59</a>). The longing of enemies for his downfall reflects a recurring motif of redemptive suffering."
