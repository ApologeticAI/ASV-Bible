      "comment": "This verse addresses God's presence and hints at the holiness required to be in God's sanctuary. 'Tent' refers to the tabernacle, the place of God's dwelling among His people. The 'holy mountain' symbolizes intimate communion with God—a theme fulfilled in Christ and the New Testament Church as the temple of the Holy Spirit (see <a href='/AIV/46/3/16'>1 Cor. 3:16</a>)."

      "comment": "This verse describes the moral integrity expected of those who seek God's presence. 'Blamelessness' often points to sincere devotion beyond outward actions. For Christians, Christ alone fulfills perfect righteousness, inviting us into a transformative relationship that enables us to share in His holiness (<a href='/AIV/58/12/14'>Heb. 12:14</a>), best experienced through full participation in the Church's sacramental life."

      "comment": "Upholding virtue, keeping one's word, and honoring the faithful reflect a higher standard of discipleship. This self-sacrificial fidelity points toward Christ, who fulfills the Law perfectly and invites believers to imitate Him within the fellowship of His people. Commitment and faithfulness, especially in sacred promises, build up not only individuals but the visible Body of Christ."

The prohibition against usury and bribes shows that faithfulness is holistic, touching on economic and social life as an expression of genuine faith. Those rooted in truth and charity stand firm forever, prefiguring those who will inherit God's Kingdom (<a href='/AIV/40/25/34'>Matt. 25:34</a>)."
