      "comment": "The phrase 'Rock of our salvation' points to God as a steadfast foundation and deliverer. In Christian interpretation, the 'Rock' has also been linked typologically to Christ, who is repeatedly called the 'cornerstone' (see <a href='/AIV/40/21/42'>Matt. 21:42</a>). The invitation to communal worship highlights the early biblical emphasis on worshipping together, foreshadowing the unified assembly of believers."

      "comment": "Thanksgiving and praise are central to worship, not only privately but in the assembly. The practice of liturgical songs connects back to temple worship, which is later echoed in apostolic tradition (<a href='/AIV/51/3/16'>Col. 3:16</a>)."
