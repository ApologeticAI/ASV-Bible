      "comment": "David cries out to God during intense opposition, traditionally seen as when he fled from Absalom (see 2 Samuel 15:12). In Christian tradition, Psalm 3 prefigures the suffering of Christ surrounded by enemies before His victory. The rising of many against David recalls the spiritual warfare faced by believers and Christ Himself."

      "comment": "David's enemies doubt God's willingness or ability to save him. This echoes mockery faced by Christ on the cross (Matthew 27:43), showing a deeper spiritual meaning: True deliverance comes from God's faithfulness, regardless of the world's doubts."

      "comment": "God is depicted as protector, source of honor, and restorer. The language of 'shield' signifies God's intimate care (see Ps. 28:7). The lifting of the head hints at resurrection and restoration—a shadow of how Christ was raised and glorified after humiliation."

      "comment": "The 'holy mountain' refers to Zion, a symbol of God's presence and kingship (Ps. 2:6). David’s confidence in God answering prayer from his sanctuary foreshadows the Christian understanding of intercession and authoritative mediation from God's dwelling place."

This language points toward ultimate victory over evil, and the spiritual defeat of adversaries through divine power. The phrase 'break the teeth' symbolizes total disarmament of evil."

This verse is foundational for understanding the role of divine grace, God's initiative in salvation, and how blessing comes through belonging to the community chosen by God—prefiguring the Church as the vessel of grace."
