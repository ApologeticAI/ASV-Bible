      "comment": "This verse recalls the Exodus, a foundational act in salvation history that prefigures deliverance from sin in Christ. The emphasis on 'foreign tongue' underscores Israel's separation and consecration for divine purposes. The Exodus foreshadows the journey from bondage to spiritual freedom (<a href='/AIV/45/6/17'>Rom. 6:17</a>)."
