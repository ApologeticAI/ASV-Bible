      "comment": "James warns that teaching comes with greater responsibility and accountability before God, echoing Jesus’ warning about the Pharisees (see Matt. 23:8). The church’s structure includes offices of responsibility, hinting at established leadership. The strong warning upholds the importance of sound teaching, a theme further developed in later apostolic tradition."

      "comment": "James admits universal human weakness, connecting to Jesus’ teaching on perfect holiness (Matt. 5:48). The mark of maturity is self-mastery, especially over speech. The idea of progression toward spiritual perfection is consistent with sanctification and the transformative journey of faith."
