      "comment": "This verse follows the judgment described in chapter 3, showing the aftermath of devastation where women seek protection and dignity through marriage. The shame mentioned may refer to social reproach, likely from widowhood or barrenness. There's a subtle hint toward restoration by being united to a name, which Christians often see as foreshadowing being united to Christ (cf. <a href='/AIV/45/8/1'>Rom. 8:1</a>), who takes away our shame. The number seven has symbolic meaning of completeness throughout Scripture."

      "comment": "The 'Branch of the LORD' is a messianic term, pointing to the coming of the Anointed One. The promise of restoration after judgment is shown in the imagery of fruitful land. Christians see Christ as the Branch (cf. <a href='/AIV/40/2/23'>Matt. 2:23</a>; <a href='/AIV/43/15/5'>John 15:5</a>), whose glory and beauty shine after suffering. The survivors of Israel represent the faithful remnant—echoing spiritual truths about perseverance and union with the true Vine."

      "comment": "The faithful remnant, those 'written among the living,' point to the concept of the Book of Life (cf. <a href='/AIV/66/3/5'>Rev. 3:5</a>). Holiness is here defined by being set apart and preserved, which can be seen as an early hint toward the sanctifying work God does in his people. There’s strong parallel to future promises of salvation and being counted among God’s elect. The language subtly anticipates New Testament teaching about being called holy and set apart."

      "comment": "Divine purification is described with water and fire, motifs both for cleansing and judgment. This echoes New Testament typology of baptism and purgation (cf. <a href='/AIV/43/3/5'>John 3:5</a>). The dual symbols of water and fire anticipate later teaching on regeneration by the Spirit and the purifying power of God's judgment. This rich imagery calls to mind sacraments and spiritual renewal central to Christian practice, emphasizing the necessity of cleansing before entering God’s presence."

      "comment": "The imagery recalls the Exodus, where God’s presence was manifest in cloud and fire, now promised over Zion and its gatherings. The 'covering' or canopy hints at God's abiding protection and presence with his people—later symbolized in teaching on God's abiding presence in the assembly of believers (cf. <a href='/AIV/40/18/20'>Matt. 18:20</a>). This also points forward to the Incarnation and God dwelling with his people. Historically, such symbols developed into tangible rituals emphasizing the real presence of God among his people."

      "comment": "The final verse promises protection—a shelter and refuge—from all harm. In spiritual interpretation, this anticipates the safety and solace granted to believers in God’s kingdom (cf. <a href='/AIV/19/91/1'>Ps. 91:1</a>). The physical imagery layers into spiritual truths: the faithful are guarded and shielded within God’s presence and assembly. Historically, this vision of divine protection and communal worship points forward to the continuation of sacred tradition and sacramental life as God's means of sheltering his people."
