      "comment": "Jesus specifically cited this verse when he began his ministry (<a href='/AIV/42/4/18-21'>Luke 4:18-21</a>), making it a clear prophecy pointing to the Messiah. The anointing with the Spirit highlights a chosen one through whom God's blessings would flow, foreshadowing a specific office set apart by God to mediate grace to his people. This verse also points to a ministry of physical and spiritual healing, echoing a continual tradition of God working through tangible actions."

      "comment": "Jesus read up to the 'year of the LORD's favor,' stopping before the 'day of vengeance,' indicating a present age of mercy ushered in by the Messiah. The 'year of favor' points to Jubilee symbolism (see <a href='/AIV/3/25/10'>Leviticus 25:10</a>), prefiguring spiritual renewal and setting free prisoners of sin."

      "comment": "The transformation from mourning to joy anticipates the beatitudes (see <a href='/AIV/40/5/4'>Matthew 5:4</a>), where true comfort and blessedness come through God's action. The image of 'oaks of righteousness' emphasizes a permanent and visible sign of God's grace working through his chosen people, rooting and sustaining them publicly as witnesses of his glory."

      "comment": "Restoration signifies a spiritual renewal and rebuilding of God's people. There's both a literal sense (post-exile rebuilding) and a spiritual one: through Christ and his body, God establishes a people that renew creation and restore what was broken. The Acts 15 reference shows the apostles applying these promises to the gathering of all nations into God’s assembly."
