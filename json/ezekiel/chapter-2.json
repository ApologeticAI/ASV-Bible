      "comment": "The address 'son of man' emphasizes Ezekiel's humanity before God, a reminder of humility for those called to serve. This phrase is later applied to Jesus in the Gospels, indicating not just humanity but divinely appointed authority (see Mark 8:38)."

      "comment": "Hard-heartedness recalls the Israelites' history of resisting God's word. The phrase 'Thus says the Lord GOD' marks Ezekiel's message as carrying divine authority, paralleling Christ's later use of 'Truly, truly, I say to you.'"

      "comment": "Ezekiel is commanded to partake of the word symbolically by eating, prefiguring receiving God's word interiorly. This anticipates spiritual nourishment themes, as in Revelation 10:9, and highlights the importance of interiorizing the divine message—hinting at sacramental reality."

      "comment": "Writing on both sides shows the completeness of God's message—nothing is omitted. The content is judgment and sorrow, preparing God's prophet (and ultimately, God's people) for the seriousness of divine revelation and the call to self-examination prior to restoration. The fullness of both warning and hope finds its ultimate expression in the New Covenant."
