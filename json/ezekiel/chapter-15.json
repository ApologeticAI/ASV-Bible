      "comment": "The 'vine' here symbolizes Israel (cf. Ps. 80:8-16). God questions the value of the vine compared to other trees: without fruit, it is not even useful for wood. This sets up the theme of purpose and judgment."

      "comment": "Being 'thrown into fire' anticipates judgment for unfaithfulness. Jesus later uses similar language for the unfruitful branches (John 15:6), making a strong christological connection about remaining in Him for true fruitfulness."
