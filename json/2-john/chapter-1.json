      "comment": "The term 'elder' indicates a position of shepherding authority in the early church, hinting at a structured community. The 'chosen lady' is often understood as either a respected Christian woman or, symbolically, a local church, with 'her children' meaning the members. The concept of truth here emphasizes unity in doctrine and love."

      "comment": "John highlights the indwelling and continual presence of truth, which in Christian belief refers both to Christ himself (John 14:6; John 14:17) and to the faith handed down. The emphasis on the truth 'remaining' alludes to perseverance and the safeguarding of apostolic teaching."

      "comment": "The denial of Jesus's true Incarnation is labeled as antichrist, marking the great dividing line in Christian definition.
