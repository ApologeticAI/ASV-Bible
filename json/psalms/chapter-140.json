      "comment": "David opens with a plea for deliverance from those who plot evil, a recurring theme in Psalms. Tradition sees this as both a literal prayer and a foreshadowing of Christ's resistance against wickedness (cf. Psalm 22). The spiritual life often requires seeking God's protection in times of persecution."

      "comment": "The closing promise of dwelling in God's presence echoes themes of the sanctity found in worship and eternal communion with God (cf. Rev. 21:3). Giving thanks points toward liturgical prayer life, and the sense of ‘dwelling’ anticipates the fulfillment of promises in Christ and the church."
