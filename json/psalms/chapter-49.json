      "comment": "Death as shepherd is a reversal of Psalm 23’s ‘the Lord is my shepherd.’ Christ’s resurrection transforms death’s power, as taught by the Church. Also subtly highlights the Catholic belief in Christ as the Good Shepherd who saves from death."

      "comment": "The psalm contrasts human impotence with God’s saving power. ‘He will take me’ prefigures Enoch (Gen. 5:24) and Elijah, but also prefigures the Church’s teaching on corporeal resurrection and the hope of eternal life through Christ."
