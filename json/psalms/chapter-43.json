      "comment": "This verse opens with a plea for justice from God, echoing other lament Psalms where the psalmist seeks divine intervention against enemies. There is an implicit trust in God's righteous judgment—a theme that is foundational for understanding Christ as the ultimate advocate and judge (cf. John 5:22). Catholics might see in this, too, a reflection of intercessory prayer, where the faithful seek God’s deliverance, similar to saints pleading on our behalf."

      "comment": "The psalmist expresses faith in God as refuge but wrestles with feelings of abandonment—an emotional tension resolved in Christ's Passion (cf. Matthew 27:46). Notice how this process of lament and trust forms the basis for deeper spiritual growth, reflected in the Catholic tradition of redemptive suffering and the value of persistence in prayer."

      "comment": "God’s light and truth guiding to His holy dwelling hints at Old Testament references to Zion and foreshadows Christ as both light and truth (John 8:12, John 14:6). For Catholics, this recalls the pilgrimage to the Eucharist—the 'dwelling place' of God with His people in the Mass. Subtly, this verse points to sacramental worship and the ongoing revelation of God’s truth in the Church."

      "comment": "Approaching the altar emphasizes worship in God’s presence, a central idea for Catholic liturgy. The reference to the altar subtly invites reflection on the importance of sacrificial worship, fulfilled in the Eucharist, where Christ is both Priest and offering (Hebrews 9:14). For Protestants, this verse might prompt deeper consideration of sacramental worship and Christ’s ongoing presence in the Church."

      "comment": "The internal dialogue concludes the psalm, echoing Psalm 42 and inviting readers to trust in God despite suffering. This anticipates the full redemption accomplished by Jesus, our Savior—the one hope that unites all Christians. The Catholic interpretation emphasizes continuing to praise God through trials, often in community worship, hinting at the supportive role of the Church and the communion of saints. The use of 'my Savior and my God' highlights Christological fulfillment, as in John 20:28."
