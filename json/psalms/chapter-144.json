      "comment": "David praises God as his firm foundation and personal trainer in spiritual and physical warfare. This echoes Psalm 18:34, where God empowers David for battle. Note the dual sense—God prepares both for literal combat and for the inner spiritual struggle against evil. The imagery of God as 'rock' also foreshadows the unshakeable foundation of the Church (cf. Matt. 16:18)."

      "comment": "The Lord is described with images of protection, such as fortress and shield. This language not only expresses security but also personal intimacy ('steadfast love'). To 'bring my people under me' indicates God's provision for righteous leadership, hinting at God's establishment of order and succession—important theological themes about authority and spiritual hierarchy."

      "comment": "David marvels at God's condescension to human beings. The phrase 'son of man' connects to Psalm 8:4 and, in a deeper sense, prefigures the title Jesus takes on Himself in the Gospels (see Heb. 2:6), suggesting both humility and messianic dignity."

      "comment": "God's intervention in battle is described with cosmic imagery—lightning and arrows. Such language is used elsewhere (Ps. 18:14), portraying God as the true deliverer against evil. Spiritually understood, this is God's triumph over sin and spiritual enemies."
