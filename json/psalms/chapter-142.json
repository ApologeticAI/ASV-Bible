      "comment": "This verse emphasizes direct and vocal prayer to God in times of distress, reflecting the biblical tradition of pouring out the heart before God. Note the repetition of 'to the LORD', which shows a deep dependence and trust. Early Christian writers saw such cries as symbolizing the soul's longing for communion with God, foreshadowing the continual prayer of the saints."

      "comment": "Being transparent before God is a key theme here—hiding nothing. The act of pouring out one's complaint is both literal and spiritual: an honest lament and a spiritual surrender. This openness is a model for personal prayer and confession, as reflected in New Testament calls to 'confess your sins' (James 5:16)."

      "comment": "This verse combines despair and divine knowledge: God knows even when our spirit fails. The 'trap' is both a literal danger and an image of spiritual warfare (Eph. 6:12). Christologically, Jesus Himself prays with anguish (Luke 22:44), foreshadowing our union with His sufferings and the assurance of God's omniscient care."

      "comment": "The imagery of loneliness and abandonment speaks to the experience of Christ in the Garden and on the Cross (Matt. 26:56). The phrase 'no one cares for my soul' foreshadows the need for a mediator and an intercessor—fulfilled in Christ and in the ministry established for caring for souls. Spiritually, this suggests the importance of community and the practice of intercessory prayer."

      "comment": "Calling God 'refuge' and 'portion' echoes inheritance language in the Old Testament (Num. 18:20), signifying both material and spiritual provision. Interpreters highlight this as a type of the believer’s share in the kingdom (Col. 1:12), and by extension, the belief in visible signs of God’s sustaining grace available to God’s people."

      "comment": "A humble prayer seeking deliverance resonates throughout salvation history, from Moses to Christ’s petition at Gethsemane (Mark 14:36). The phrase 'they are too strong for me' highlights human weakness and the absolute need for divine intervention. The early Church interpreted such words as a call to trust not merely in personal spiritual experiences but in the means of grace given for deliverance."

      "comment": "Soul as 'in prison' is a metaphor for bondage to sin, despair, or oppression. The act of thanksgiving after deliverance prefigures worship in assembly and the communal aspect of faith. The righteous gathering suggests restoration into the fellowship—hinting at the importance of visible, united worship and thanksgiving. Early commentators saw this as a type of the resurrection and the gathering of believers around the presence of the Lord."
