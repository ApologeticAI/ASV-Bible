      "comment": "This verse highlights the Lord's readiness to respond to those who call on Him in trouble. The structure underscores the intimacy of prayer, prefiguring Christ's own prayers in distress (Hebrews 5:7)."

      "comment": "The psalmist prays for deliverance not from physical danger but from slander and false accusation. This echoes the need for truth, a virtue Christ exemplified (John 14:6), and a theme repeated in James 3:5-10 regarding the power of the tongue."

      "comment": "Divine retribution is depicted vividly. Arrows and burning coals reflect God's justice poured out upon the wicked (cf. Ephesians 6:16—imagery of spiritual warfare). Early Christian interpreters saw in this a warning about spiritual consequences for those who prefer falsehood over God's truth."

      "comment": "Meshech and Kedar represent distant peoples, often viewed as hostile or pagan neighbors. The psalmist laments spiritual alienation. Christians throughout history have interpreted this as a longing for our true home, echoing Hebrews 13:14—'For here we have no lasting city'."

      "comment": "Here, the suffering of living among the unfaithful is stressed. Spiritually, it reflects the Church’s journey through a world often opposed to God's peace. It foreshadows Christ, the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6; John 14:27), whose followers are also called to persevere amid opposition."

      "comment": "Though the psalmist seeks peace, he encounters hostility. This condition mirrors that of Christ, who is rejected despite bringing reconciliation (cf. John 1:11; Romans 5:10-11). The call to be a peacemaker finds deep resonance here, linking the psalmist’s plight to the Beatitudes."
