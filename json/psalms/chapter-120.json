      "comment": "This verse opens with a prayerful cry to the LORD in a time of trouble. It reminds us that God hears those who call on Him in sincerity and faith, an idea picked up throughout the Psalms and fulfilled supremely in Christ, who intercedes for us (<a href='/AIV/58/7/25'>Heb. 7:25</a>)."

      "comment": "A plea for protection from falsehood and slander. The theme of truth versus lies is central, reflecting the need for purity not only of speech but of heart, prefiguring the call to inner transformation in the New Testament (<a href='/AIV/40/5/8'>Matt. 5:8</a>)."

It captures both the suffering of God’s people and the example of Christ, who is the true Prince of Peace (<a href='/AIV/23/9/6'>Isa. 9:6</a>; <a href='/AIV/40/5/9'>Matt. 5:9</a>). The spiritual interpretation urges unity and the pursuit of reconciliation—key marks of authentic faith."
