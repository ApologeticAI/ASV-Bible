      "comment": "This urgent cry for help is also found in <a href='/AIV/19/40/13'>Psalm 40:13</a>. The use of both 'God' and 'Lord' emphasizes the psalmist’s trust in God’s personal relationship and almighty power. In a spiritual reading, this verse models how Christians are invited to call upon God with persistence, echoing the New Testament call to pray without ceasing (<a href='/AIV/52/5/17'>1 Thess. 5:17</a>)."

      "comment": "This imprecatory prayer entrusts vengeance and justice to God, reflecting the faith that God will defend His faithful. Jesus’ command to pray for enemies (<a href='/AIV/40/5/44'>Matt. 5:44</a>) brings out a deeper spiritual fulfillment, asking for enemies’ conversion and ultimate good."

      "comment": "Verbal scorn is often directed at God’s anointed ones. This is echoed in the passion of Christ, who was mocked by scoffers (<a href='/AIV/41/15/29-32'>Mark 15:29-32</a>). The spiritual application points to joining Christ in suffering and responding to mockery with humility and perseverance."

      "comment": "This verse links joy with seeking God sincerely. The refrain 'God is great!' resembles the doxologies used in early Christian worship. The phrase 'love Your salvation' hints at a living hope in God’s promised deliverance—a theme echoed in <a href='/AIV/42/2/25-32'>Luke 2:25-32</a>, as Simeon recognizes salvation in the promised Messiah."

      "comment": "The psalmist’s humility—confessing spiritual poverty—points forward to Christ’s Beatitudes: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit' (<a href='/AIV/40/5/3'>Matt. 5:3</a>). Relying on God alone, as 'my help and my deliverer,' is a confession found throughout the psalms, encouraging believers to continually trust in God for salvation, both in life and in the hope of resurrection."
