      "comment": "The term 'sons of God' (Hebrew: 'bene elohim') can mean angelic beings, but also points to God's heavenly assembly—echoing divine council language seen elsewhere. Christians, by faith and baptism, are also adopted as sons of God (see <a href='/AIV/45/8/15'>Rom. 8:15</a>), hinting at both little and great spiritual realities."
