      "comment": "The use of 'name' signifies God's revealed character and authority. In the Old Testament, invoking God's name often implies seeking His presence and power—foreshadowing Christ's authority as revealed in the New Testament (cf. John 17:11-12). Catholic liturgy frequently invokes the Holy Name, reflecting this ancient tradition."

      "comment": "David faces enemies who act without reverence for God, recalling situations of persecution faced by the righteous—prefiguring Christ, who was persecuted by those who 'knew not the Father' (John 16:3). The 'Selah' invites reflective, meditative pause, as in traditional liturgical worship."

      "comment": "‘Helper’ and ‘Sustainer’ highlight God's providential care, echoing typologically the Holy Spirit ('the Helper' in John 14:26). The Church Fathers saw God's ongoing sustenance as a model for how grace—the sacraments above all—continually nourishes and upholds the soul in the journey toward salvation."

      "comment": "God’s justice is trusted to vindicate the righteous, a theme that points both to temporal deliverance and, ultimately, to final judgment at the end of time (cf. Matthew 25:31-46). Catholic theology sees God’s 'faithfulness' here as His covenant fidelity, fulfilled perfectly in Christ and perpetuated through His Church."

The Psalm's ending inspires confidence in God's providence—expressed in trust, thanksgiving, and sacrificial worship."
