      "comment": "Crying out 'from the end of the earth' implies distance or even exile, yet God's presence is accessible. The 'rock higher than I' evokes God as a secure refuge, prefiguring Christ (see Matt. 7:24), the ultimate foundation for every soul."

      "comment": "The psalmist's request to dwell 'in your tent forever' evokes both the temple/tabernacle imagery and abiding in God's presence perpetually. Seeking refuge 'under your wings' alludes to intimate care and protection, a powerful covenant image (see Ps. 91:4), spiritually fulfilled in being gathered into God's family."
