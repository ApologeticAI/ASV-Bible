      "comment": "Zion, representing God’s chosen dwelling, surpasses even the rest of Israel's places. This hints at the unique role of God's holy assembly and anticipates the New Testament teaching about the Church as the new spiritual Zion (<a href='/AIV/58/12/22'>Heb. 12:22</a>)."

The prophecy is both literal (Jerusalem) and spiritual, pointing to the gathering of God’s people, fulfilled in the Body of Christ and its unity. The 'Selah' reminds the reader to pause and reflect on this divine mystery."

      "comment": "Rahab is a poetic name for Egypt; Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, Cush—all classic Gentile nations—are included among those who come to know God. This anticipates the bringing in of the Gentiles into God’s people, a theme expounded in the New Testament (Eph. 2:13-19). Their spiritual rebirth in Zion hints at sacraments that initiate believers into God’s family."

      "comment": "This affirms that true citizenship in the city of God is by spiritual birth, echoing Jesus’ teaching on being 'born again' (John 3:3). The idea that the Lord Himself establishes Zion points to the divine origin and protection of God’s one holy assembly."

This connects with Christ’s promise of living water (<a href='/AIV/43/7/37-39'>John 7:37-39</a>), which flows from God’s presence to the believer. The image also prefigures the liturgical life and worship at the heart of the Christian community."
