      "comment": "This verse uses 'gods' ('elohim'), likely referring to human judges or rulers, not deities. Jesus references this passage in <a href='/AIV/43/10/34'>John 10:34</a>, showing how true authority comes from God. Catholics understand the assembly as a divine council, prefiguring the Church as the mystical body where God presides over His people."
