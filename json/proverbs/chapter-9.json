      "comment": "Here, Wisdom is personified. The 'seven pillars' may symbolize completeness or perfection, echoing themes of divine order—wisdom creates a secure foundation, much as the Church forms a spiritual house (see 1 Tim. 3:15). Early Christian interpreters saw Wisdom as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is the ultimate wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:24)."
