      "comment": "In ancient Israel, public displays of affection were only acceptable between family members. The longing here shows the lover's desire for closeness without shame—a theme echoed in Christian teaching about the removal of shame through spiritual union (cf. Ephesians 5:25-27)."

      "comment": "Emergence from the wilderness can symbolize Israel's exodus or spiritual journey. The reference to birth and awakening suggests both new beginnings and the nourishment found in close relationship, the way Christian tradition sees spiritual birth from 'above' (John 3:3-5)."

      "comment": "The imagery of seal represents unbreakable commitment—mirroring the indelible spiritual marks in Christian sacraments, and the fierce, total love God has for His people (cf. Isa. 49:16; 2 Cor. 1:22). 'Very flame of the LORD' shows love's divine origin, and the phrase’s rarity in the Old Testament points to the sacredness of covenant love."

      "comment": "True love is priceless and unstoppable. This models the unshakable love of Christ that cannot be bought or destroyed (cf. Rom. 8:38-39; Eph. 3:17-19). The verse also alludes to total self-giving, a pattern for all believers."
