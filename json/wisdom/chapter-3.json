      "comment": "This opening verse immediately assures the faithful of God's special protection over the righteous after death. The idea that no torment touches them hints at the peace of the just after death, a theme echoed in Jesus’ promise of eternal life. Compare John 10:28, where Christ promises none can snatch believers from His hand."
