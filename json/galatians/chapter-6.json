      "comment": "This verse emphasizes both fraternal correction and humility. The restoration is not punitive but gentle, reflecting the spiritual maturity to heal rather than condemn. The caution to guard oneself also points to the communal nature of accountability within the body of believers, aligning with the principle of confession (James 5:16)."
