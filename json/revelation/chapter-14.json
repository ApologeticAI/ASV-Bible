      "comment": "The Lamb refers to Christ, standing in victory on Zion, a symbol of God's dwelling and authority. The 144,000 is a symbolic number representing completeness and God's faithful people, potentially a reference to the fullness of God's people rather than a literal count (see Rev. 7:4). The reference to God's name written on foreheads echoes the spiritual sealing of God's people."
