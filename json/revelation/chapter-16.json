The bowls are symbols for the fullness and completeness of divine judgment, reminiscent of the Old Testament plagues. The temple reference indicates the action is commanded directly by God, drawing parallels to His direct intervention in history (see Lev. 26:21)."

Notice the sacramental imagery of a ‘mark’—a sign of belonging, which will be echoed and contrasted with the seal of the faithful elsewhere in Revelation."
