      "comment": "The image of the woman has deep symbolic meaning. The twelve stars recall the twelve tribes of Israel and also point toward the later twelve apostles. Many traditional interpreters see spiritual significance in the woman's radiant glory, recalling Old Testament images (Gen. 37:9) and pointing to the destiny of God's people fulfilled in Christ's coming."
