      "comment": "This verse connects the faithful examples from chapter 11 to our own Christian lives. 'Cloud of witnesses' refers to these former faithful—this is often interpreted as evidence of a real fellowship uniting believers across time (see also 1 Cor. 12:12; Rev. 6:9-11). The 'race' metaphor emphasizes active participation in salvation, not merely belief."
