      "comment": "Jonah's prayer uses language similar to the Psalms, reflecting a pattern of lament and trust in deliverance. The phrase 'out of the depths of the grave' points to themes of death and resurrection, which will later be fulfilled in Christ's own death and victory over the grave. See also Matthew 12:40."
