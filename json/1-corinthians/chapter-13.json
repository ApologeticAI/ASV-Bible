      "comment": "Paul emphasizes that supernatural gifts like speaking in tongues are empty without genuine love. The reference to 'tongues of men and of angels' stresses eloquence and spiritual gifts but insists on love as the true mark of the Christian. Note the spiritual interpretation: spiritual gifts serve the Church only when motivated by love."

      "comment": "Knowledge, faith, and prophecy are highly valued in the church, yet Paul makes clear that their highest purpose is fulfilled only in love. Moving mountains is hyperbolic, echoing Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 17:20, but the ultimate measure is love. This points to the necessity of charity as the foundation of Christian life and ministry."

This standard calls all believers to imitate Christ, who is the perfect model of patience and kindness. The Church’s unity is preserved by living out this kind of love."
