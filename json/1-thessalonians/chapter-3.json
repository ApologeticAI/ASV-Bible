      "comment": "Paul and his companions, deeply concerned for the Thessalonians and unable to wait any longer, decide to stay in Athens alone. This reveals pastoral concern and sacrificial leadership, echoing the shepherd's care throughout the New Testament (<a href='/AIV/43/10/11'>John 10:11</a>)."

Sending Timothy to strengthen and encourage the faith of the Thessalonians suggests an apostolic support structure for believers. Early church authority and accountability are highlighted here."
