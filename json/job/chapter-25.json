      "comment": "‘Dominion and awe’ emphasizes God’s sovereign power. 'Peace in His high places' hints at the harmony of the heavenly order, which echoes biblical themes of the heavenly temple and God’s throne (Isaiah 6:1-3). This verse subtly reflects the reality of God's government in heaven, which spiritually connects to the idea of order and unity in God’s people. The peace described in ‘high places’ is often seen as a foreshadowing of ultimate peace with God, later fulfilled in Christ (Col. 1:20)."

      "comment": "God’s ‘armies’ here refers to His angels or heavenly hosts, reflecting the vastness of divine power (Luke 2:13; Heb. 12:22). The light that rises upon all connects symbolically to the universal reach of God’s wisdom and revelation (John 1:9). The notion of countless hosts subtly supports the idea of an ongoing divine reality beyond the visible world, as encountered in biblical worship and communion."

      "comment": "This verse centers on the impossibility of absolute righteousness or purity before God by human effort alone. It prepares the reader for the necessity of grace, which is foundational for salvation (Eph. 2:8–9). There is also a subtle anticipation of Christ, born of woman, who alone fulfills perfect righteousness (Gal. 4:4–5). The spiritual interpretation points to the need for transformation by God’s grace, made real through faith and participation in the life of the believing community."

      "comment": "The created order (moon and stars) pales before God's holiness. This poetic expression means not even heavenly bodies are perfectly pure compared to God, underscoring His transcendent holiness. It holds a spiritual reminder of the need for sanctification, something worked in the believer’s life through union with Christ (Heb. 12:14)."

      "comment": "The imagery of 'maggot' and 'worm' starkly portrays human frailty and humble status before God. There is also a spiritual parallel to Psalm 22:6, which prophetically foreshadows Christ's suffering and humiliation on behalf of humanity. This prepares a theological foundation for understanding the necessity of divine mercy, and the invitation for believers to participate in a deeper, sacrificial relationship with God—imaged supremely in Christ's own humility (Phil. 2:5–8)."
