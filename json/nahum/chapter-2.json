      "comment": "The 'scatterer' likely refers to the invading army sent as judgment upon Nineveh. The call to prepare defenses shows both the literal historical context and a spiritual warning about the inevitability of divine justice. Preparation and vigilance are recurring exhortations for God's people (Matt. 24:42)."

      "comment": "Restoration language points to God's faithfulness to His covenant people, even when allowing chastisement. The vine metaphor recalls Israel’s vocation (Isa. 5:1–7) and points to Christ as the True Vine (John 15:1). Multiple fulfillments are implied—temporal restoration and an eschatological fulfillment."

      "comment": "This vivid battle imagery describes the invading force—possibly the Medes and Babylonians. The symbolism of blood and fire (red/scarlet) prefigures judgment. The preparation motif anticipates New Testament calls to put on armor (Eph. 6:10–17)."

      "comment": "Nineveh’s downfall is certain—exile was a common form of judgment. The mourning of the maidservants demonstrates the depth of loss, paralleling the lamentations over Jerusalem (Lam. 1:4). Spiritually, the imagery prefigures the sorrow from being separated from God’s presence."
