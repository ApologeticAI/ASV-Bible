      "comment": "Wisdom transforms not just understanding but a person's outward demeanor. Wisdom in the Bible is depicted as a gift from God. Compare Proverbs, which elevates wisdom as vital to spiritual life. A transformed countenance points to the renewal brought by truth, prefiguring how Christ transforms believers inwardly and outwardly (2 Cor. 3:18)."

Obedience is seen as fidelity to divine order, a principle influencing traditions of apostolic succession and reverence for established authority."
