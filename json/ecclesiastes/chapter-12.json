      "comment": "The call to remember God early in life anticipates approaching old age and its difficulties. This verse encourages devotion from youth, aligning with the tradition of sanctifying one’s entire life to God. The phrase 'Creator' in Hebrew is plural, possibly pointing to the majesty of God and serves as a subtle hint of the unity and mystery within God’s being (cf. Gen. 1:26)."

      "comment": "Imagery of celestial bodies fading describes the coming of old age when the senses and faculties diminish. The recurring clouds suggest ongoing troubles near the end of life. The poetic language foreshadows eschatological themes—anticipating physical mortality and hinting at the soul’s longing for an eternal light."
