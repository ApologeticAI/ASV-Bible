      "comment": "The call to remember the Creator early in life is literal, but also hints at a spiritual return to God before worldly cares overwhelm the soul. Classic Christian tradition interprets this as an exhortation to lifelong devotion, not just fleeting youthful zeal."

      "comment": "Symbolic language: the 'keepers' are hands, 'strong men' are legs, 'grinders' are teeth, 'windows' are eyes—all fading with age. This reminds us of the dignity of the whole human person and the need to prepare spiritually for the inevitability of death."

      "comment": "While study is good, the inspired word brings certainty that endless human speculation cannot. This sets apart divinely preserved wisdom from sheer intellectual pursuit and mirrors deference to established tradition."
