      "comment": "The verse expresses God’s sovereignty over human destiny, subtlely emphasizing predestination and divine providence. There is an echo of trust in God's mysterious plan, reinforced in Psalm 31:15. While salvation is ultimately in God's hands, wisdom and righteousness flow from a heart in right communion with Him."
