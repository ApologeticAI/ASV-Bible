      "comment": "Coming humbly to God's presence is a central theme. The 'house of God' at the time referred to the Temple, foreshadowing later the deeper reality of being reverent before God in worship, especially through communal liturgy. The 'sacrifice of fools' emphasizes that external acts without inner conversion are worthless (see Matt. 15:8)."
