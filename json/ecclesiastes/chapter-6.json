      "comment": "Wealth and honor themselves are not evil but can become empty if not enjoyed as God's gifts. There is a deep implication that true fulfillment comes from God, and that mere earthly gain is incomplete without a right relationship with the divine. See also the parable of the rich fool in Luke 12:16-21."

      "comment": "The value of earthly success is questioned absent spiritual fulfillment. A proper burial was a sign of honor (see Gen. 23:3-20), and to be denied even that signifies profound emptiness. Christ points to the importance of fullness of life in Him (John 10:10)."
