      "comment": "The phrase 'no knowledge of God' underlines Israel’s covenant failure and recalls similar indictments in Isaiah and Jeremiah. The lack of faithfulness and love reflects a breach in the relationship God intended. The Hebrew term for 'steadfast love' (chesed) points toward God’s desired covenantal loyalty, later embodied in Christ’s sacrificial love."
