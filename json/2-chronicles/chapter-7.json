      "comment": "The descent of fire from heaven is a sign of divine approval and presence, echoing other moments in Scripture where God manifests himself through fire (Lev. 9:24, 1 Kings 18:38). The glory filling the temple prefigures the indwelling of God's presence among his people, later fulfilled spiritually through Christ and the Church. Note the continuity between the sacrificial system and later New Testament themes of offering and sanctification."
