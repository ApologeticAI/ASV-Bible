      "text": "In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:",

      "comment": "This opening sets the historical context for the prophecy. The term 'the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai' reveals the prophetic office as a mediator between God and his people. The mention of both the governor and high priest underscores God’s concern for both spiritual and civic leadership, hinting at the integrated structure of authority among God’s people."

      "comment": "The phrase 'the LORD of hosts' emphasizes God's supreme authority over all powers. The people's excuse to delay building the Temple reveals spiritual apathy. The Temple represents God’s dwelling among his people—a theme later fulfilled in Christ, the true Temple (see <a href='/AIV/43/2/19-21'>John 2:19–21</a>)."
